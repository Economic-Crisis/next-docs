## Introduction

Next Docs is a library that makes developing a Next.js docs easier, built for
App Router. It offers server-side functions and headless components.

- Search (using flexsearch)
- Breadcrumb, Sidebar, TOC Components
- Additional utilities

It's recommended to use Next Docs with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) +
[Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com), and
[Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev) (or any CMS).

> **Tip:** For normal usages, you can use [Next Docs UI](/docs/ui) instead.

```bash
npm install next-docs-zeta shiki
```

### Demo

Open in [CodeSandbox](https://githubbox.com/SonMooSans/next-docs-template).

## Guide

1. #### Choose a Source

   Next Docs has native support for ContentLayer, but any kind of formats and
   sources are allowed.

   You can refer to this [guide](/docs/headless/contentlayer) to learn how to
   use Contentlayer with Next Docs.

2. #### Build Page Tree

   A page tree refers to structured data of all pages.

   ```js
   export const tree = [
     {
       type: 'page',
       name: 'Quick Start',
       url: '/docs'
     },
     {
       type: 'separator',
       name: 'Guides'
     },
     {
       type: 'page',
       name: 'Example',
       url: '/docs/example'
     }
   ]
   ```

   You can generate the tree using our Contentlayer adapter, or end up with
   writing your own.

3. #### Create MDX file

   Create `/content/docs/index.mdx`:

   ```mdx
   ---
   title: Quick Start
   description: My cool docs
   ---

   Hello World
   ```

4. #### Styling & Fun

   Start styling your docs with headless components provided by Next Docs.

   ```mdx
   <article>
     <nav>
       <p>My App</p>
       <SearchToggle />

     <Sidebar />
     <MDXContent />
